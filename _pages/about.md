I am interested in quantum computation and information, particularly on noise characterization protocols, low-level compilation of quantum circuit and gates, and optimal control of gate pulses. Currently an undergraduate student, I am pursuing a double major in physics and mathematics, with a focus on the theoretical and computational aspects of these fields.

I am currently an undergraduate researcher at [EPiQC](https://www.epiqc.cs.uchicago.edu/) and previously worked at [Infleqtion](https://www.infleqtion.com/) in the development of their hardware-aware quantum circuit compiler [Superstaq](https://www.infleqtion.com/superstaq).
