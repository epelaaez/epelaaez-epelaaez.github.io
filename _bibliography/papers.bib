  abstract={The use of vectorial parameterization to create geometrical representations in computational models has a large number of applications. One particular application is the calculation of the 3D rotational motion of rigid bodies, that could be used for the spatial location estimation from objects. Provided the algebraic nature of this problem, it could benefit from Quantum Computing, in particular several vectors could be superposed to be transformed with a single operation, providing a quantum processing advantage. In this article, we propose an implementation of a Quantum Computing algorithm to compute Euler-Rodrigues Parameters to model rigid body rotations to transform arbitrary functions, rotating multiple vectors in superposition. We developed this algorithm using Qiskit, taking into account the limitations imposed by the current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, such as the reduced number of qubits available and the limited coherence time.},

  author={Pel{\'a}ez, Emilio and Pham, Minh and Shrikant, U},
  abstract={In this chapter, we introduce some of the notions of quantum information science including aspects of information, information security, entanglement states, quantum gates, teleportation, direct secure communication, quantum secret sharing, quantum noise, quantum operations, quantum error correction, quantum circuits and quantum Toffoli gate. Most of these aspects are of importance in quantum enhanced technologies including quantum blockchain. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the basic notions of quantum information science aspects with its real-time need and usage, including some notes on how the above mentioned concepts and tools might be helpful in quantum blockchain technology. The chapter is organized into three major sections as follows. Starting from postulates of quantum mechanics, which set the basic rules of the theory which drastically deviates from the classical mechanics. Then we introduce, in Sect. 1 the basic notions of quantum information (QI) science as described in the abstract. Section 2 is dedicated to multiple controlled Toffoli gate, which may find its application in may areas of quantum computing and also in quantum blockchain. Section 3 is dedicated to certain aspects of quantum error correction, a scheme to protect qubits (units of quantum information) from environmental noise, which helps develop fault-tolerant quantum technologies. },
